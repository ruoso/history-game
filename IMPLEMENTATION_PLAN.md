# Implementation Plan

## Core Components

### 1. Project Structure
- Create CMake build system with FetchContent for dependencies
- Set up googletest for testing
- Configure inside-out-objects library integration

### 2. Core System Architecture

#### Entity System
- `Entity`: Base class using managed_entity from inside-out-objects
- `World`: Container managing all entities and simulation state
- `Position`: Component for spatial positioning
- `SimulationClock`: Track simulation time and generational progression

#### NPC Core
- `NPC`: Core entity representing NPCs and player
- `DriveSystem`: Manages emotional drives and their dynamics
- `Drive`: Enumeration and intensity values for different drives
- `ActionSystem`: Action selection and execution framework

#### Memory System
- `PerceptionBuffer`: Short-term memory for recent observations
- `MemoryEntry`: Individual action/observation memories
- `ActionSequence`: Timed sequences of actions with meaning
- `MemoryEpisode`: Meaningful remembered experiences with emotional impact
- `WitnessedSequence`: Observed behaviors that can be imitated

#### Relationship System
- `Relationship`: Track familiarity and emotional connections
- `RelationshipManager`: Handle relationship updates and queries

#### Object System
- `WorldObject`: Base class for all interactable objects
- Object category implementations (Food, Structure, etc.)
- `ObjectRegistry`: Track all objects and their histories

### 3. Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic entity and world systems
- NPC with simple position and drives
- Primitive actions (move, observe)
- Minimal object implementation

#### Phase 2: Memory & Action
- Complete memory system implementation
- Full action system with all actions
- Basic drive impact model
- Object interactions

#### Phase 3: Relationships & Behavior
- Relationship tracking
- Observation and imitation systems
- Sequence learning and reproduction
- Behavior propagation mechanisms

#### Phase 4: Cultural Evolution
- Multi-generational simulation
- Convergence detection
- Cultural drift and mutation
- Player integration

## Implementation Strategy

### Entity Definition Approach
Use inside-out-objects pattern:
```cpp
// Example of NPC implementation
class NPC : public io::managed_entity<NPC> {
public:
  // Public interface
private:
  // Implementation details
};
```

### Component Organization
- Separate core simulation from future rendering/UI concerns
- Use composition for entity capabilities
- Implement systems as services that operate on entities

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Simulation tests for emergent behavior validation
